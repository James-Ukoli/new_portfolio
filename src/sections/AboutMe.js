            Hello there!👋🏿 I'm James Ukoli! 👨🏽‍💻 I am an upcoming mobile developer
            that mainly works on the front end, as it showcases my creative and
            stylistic side🎨. I am currently doing my MBA at UT Tyler online 💼,
            and during my freetime, I like to explore and research on new tech
            and create mobile apps📱. Scroll down for more things about me and
            my work.😊
