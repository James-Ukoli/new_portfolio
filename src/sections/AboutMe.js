            Hello there! I'm The James Ukoli! I am an Middle School Mathematics
            Educator that has a deep passion for creating SOFTWARE. I enjoy
            working on front end mobile apps the most, as it showcases my
            creative and stylistic side. During my freetime, I like to explore
            and research on new tech and robotics. Scroll down for more things
            about me and my work. :)
